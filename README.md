# hey! I'm Meyers

I'm a master's student in Computer Science, mainly working around AI these days.

This GitHub features most of my big projects - from Machine Learning to React to Deployment as Code.

Check out my writeups on my [portfolio](https://meyersa.com).

I dabble in Python, C, C#, Lua, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
